"""
Two kinds of online translation, both via the free MyMemory API, both optional
(YO_B_ONLINE_TRANSLATION=false disables both) and both wrapped in a short timeout
and a broad except: a slow or unreachable network must never hang a request or
crash the app.

1. lookup_online(word, target) — a best-effort fallback for a single Pidgin/
   Franc-anglais word Yo-B's own dictionary doesn't cover (translation.py's
   to_french/to_english directions). There's no public API that knows Yaoundé
   Pidgin, so the source language is *guessed* as the other real language —
   which is exactly why results need to be filtered hard: a wrong guess on an
   invented or slang word easily produces a fluent-looking but meaningless
   answer (e.g. "YO" -> "OJ"). See _MIN_MATCH_SINGLE_WORD below.

2. translate_sentence_online(text, source, target) — a normal, direct
   translation between two REAL languages (French <-> English) for
   translation.py's french_to_english/english_to_french directions. No
   guessing is involved here — both language codes are exactly what the user
   selected — so this is ordinary machine translation, not a dictionary
   fallback, and is held to a lighter quality bar.
